## Introduction to Variables

In programming, a variable is a named container that holds a value. It acts as a placeholder for data that can change during the execution of a program. Variables allow programmers to store, manipulate, and retrieve data, making programs dynamic and adaptable.

To understand variables, let's start with an analogy. Imagine you have a box labeled "books." You can put different books inside the box, and you can also take books out or replace them with different books. The box represents the variable, and the books represent the value that the variable holds.

Variables have two essential components: a name and a value. The name is used to refer to the variable and access its value. The value can be of various types, such as numbers, text, or even more complex data structures.

## Code Example

Here's an example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Declare a variable named "age" and assign a value
    int age = 25;

    // Use the variable in a calculation
    int futureAge = age + 10;

    // Display the result
    cout << "In 10 years, your age will be: " << futureAge << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we declare a variable named "age" and assign it the value 25. Then, we use the variable in a calculation to determine the future age by adding 10. Finally, we print the result using the print statement.

## Algorithm:

```text
Start
Declare a variable with a name
Assign a value to the variable
Perform operations using the variable
Display or use the variable as needed
End
```
Pseudocode:

```text
DECLARE variableName
SET variableName = value
PERFORM operations using variableName
DISPLAY or use variableName as needed
```

Remember, different programming languages have their own syntax and rules for declaring and using variables, but the basic concept remains the same. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data dynamically, making programs more flexible and powerful.

## Practice Questions

As you learn about variables, try to solve the following practice questions to test your understanding, and then check the solution for each question. You can use any programming language you want. If you're using C++, you can use the online compiler to run your code.

### Question No 1: Print Your Name

Write a program that prints your name.

```text
Output: The program should print your name.

Example: 

My name is John Doe.
```

## Question No 2: Print a Message

Write a program that prints a message of your choice.

```text
Output: The program should print the message.

Welcome to the world of programming!
```

## Question No 3: Print the Sum of Two Numbers

Write a program that calculates the sum of two numbers and prints the result.

```text
Input: Assign values to two variables, num1 and num2.

Output: The program should print the sum of the two numbers.

The sum is: 8
```

## Question No 4: Print the Product of Two Numbers

Write a program that calculates the product of two numbers and prints the result.

```text
Input: Assign values to two variables, num1 and num2.

Output: The program should print the product of the two numbers.

The product is: 24
```
## Question No 5: Print the Average of Three Numbers

Write a program that calculates the average of three numbers and prints the result.

```text
Input: Assign values to three variables, num1, num2, and num3.

Output: The program should print the average of the three numbers.

The average is: 9.333333333333334
```

## Question No 6: Print the Area of a Rectangle

Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle and prints the result.

```text
Input: Assign values to two variables, length and width.

Output: The program should print the calculated area of the rectangle.

The area is: 15
```

## Question No 7: Print the Result of an Arithmetic Expression

Write a program that calculates and prints the result of the arithmetic expression: (5 + 3) * 4 / 2.

```text
Output: The program should print the result of the arithmetic expression.

The result is: 16.0
```
