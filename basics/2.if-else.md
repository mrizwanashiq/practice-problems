# If Else
## Introduction

If-else statements are a fundamental construct in programming that allow for decision-making and control flow based on specific conditions. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of if-else statements, explaining what they are, why we need them, where they are used, and other supporting information.

## What is an If-Else Statement?

An if-else statement is a programming structure that enables selective execution of code blocks based on certain conditions. It allows a program to execute different sets of instructions depending on whether a condition is `true` or `false`. The basic syntax of an if-else statement is as follows:

```js
if (condition) {
	// code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
	// code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

## Why Do We Need If-Else Statements?

If-else statements serve several important purposes in programming:

1. [Conditional Execution](#1-conditional-execution)
2. [Decision-Making](#2-decision-making)
3. [Alternatives and Branching](#3-alternatives-and-branching)
4. [Error Handling](#4-error-handling)

### 1. Conditional Execution

They facilitate the execution of specific code blocks based on whether a condition evaluates to true or false. This enables programmers to control the behavior of their programs and handle different scenarios appropriately.

### 2. Decision-Making

If-else statements allow for decision-making within programs. They enable programmers to handle various conditions and choose different actions or paths based on those conditions. This is crucial for creating dynamic and adaptable programs that respond intelligently to different situations.

### 3. Alternatives and Branching

If-else statements provide a way to handle alternatives by specifying different courses of action for different conditions. This allows programmers to handle multiple scenarios and control the program flow accordingly.

### 3. Error Handling

If-else statements can be utilized for error handling and exception management. By checking for specific conditions, programmers can identify and handle errors gracefully, providing appropriate feedback or alternative actions when unexpected situations occur.

## Where Are If-Else Statements Used?

If-else statements are used in various scenarios throughout programming:

1. [Input Validation and Checking](#1-input-validation-and-checking)
2. [Control Flow and Program Logic](#2-control-flow-and-program-logic)
3. [Decision-Making Algorithms](#3-decision-making-algorithms)
4. [User Interface Interaction](#4-user-interface-interaction)

### 1. Validation and Input Checking

They are employed to validate user input and ensure it meets specific criteria. For instance, checking if a value falls within a valid range or meets certain format requirements.

### 2. Control Flow and Program Logic

If-else statements allow programmers to create branching paths in code, controlling the program's flow based on conditions. This enables different actions or calculations to be performed depending on the input or program state.

### 3. Decision-Making Algorithms

If-else statements play a crucial role in decision-making algorithms, such as sorting, searching, or filtering operations. These algorithms determine the course of action based on specific conditions or comparison results.

### 4. User Interface Interaction

If-else statements are often utilized to control the behavior of user interfaces. They enable the interface to respond differently to user actions or input, presenting relevant information or options based on the context.

## Operators Used in If-Else Statements

If-else statements use different operators to evaluate conditions and determine if they are `true` or `false`. Here are the main operators used in if-else statements:

1. [Comparison Operators](#1-comparison-operators)
2. [Logical Operators](#2-logical-operators)

### 1. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare two values to check if they are equal, greater than, less than, or not equal. They help evaluate conditions in if-else statements.

#### Equality Operator (`==`)

The equality operator (`==`) checks if two values are equal, returning `true` if they are and `false` otherwise.

```text
0 == 0 // true
0 == 1 // false
```

#### Inequality Operator (`!=`)

The inequality operator (`!=`) checks if two values are not equal.

```text
0 != 0 // false
0 != 1 // true
```

#### Greater Than Operator (`>`)

The greater than operator (`>`) checks if the first value is greater than the second value.

```text
1 > 0 // true
0 > 1 // false
```

#### Less Than Operator (`<`)

The less than operator (`<`) checks if the first value is less than the second value.

```text
0 < 1 // true
1 < 0 // false
```

#### Greater Than or Equal To Operator (`>=`)

The greater than or equal to operator (`>=`) checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value.

```text
1 >= 0 // true
0 >= 1 // false
0 >= 0 // true
```

#### Less Than or Equal To Operator (`<=`)

The less than or equal to operator (`<=`) checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second value.

```text
0 <= 1 // true
1 <= 0 // false
0 <= 0 // true
```

### 2. Logical Operators

Logical operators combine multiple conditions and determine if they are `true` or `false`. They are useful in if-else statements.

#### Logical AND Operator (`&&`)

The logical AND operator (`&&`) checks if both conditions are `true`.

```text
0 == 0 && 1 == 1 // true
0 == 0 && 1 == 0 // false
```

#### Logical OR Operator (`||`)

The logical OR operator (`||`) checks if at least one of the conditions is `true`.

```text
0 == 0 || 1 == 1 // true
0 == 0 || 1 == 0 // true
0 == 1 || 1 == 0 // false
```

#### Logical NOT Operator (`!`)

The logical NOT operator (`!`) negates a condition, checking if it is `false`.

```text
!(0 == 0) // false
!(0 == 1) // true
```
