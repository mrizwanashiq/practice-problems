# Practice Problems

Welcome to the Practice Problems repository! This repository is a collection of general programming practice problems designed to enhance your coding skills and problem-solving abilities. Each problem comes with a detailed description, example inputs and outputs, and it's up to you to come up with a solution.

## Getting Started

To get started with the practice problems, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrizwanashiq/practice-problems.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd practice-problems
   ```

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

```
practice-problems/
â”œâ”€â”€ basics/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 1.variable.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 2.if-else.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 3.loop.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 4.array.md
```

Each problem is represented by a separate directory (problem-1, problem-2, etc.).
Inside each problem directory, you will find the README.md file containing the problem description, examples, and sometimes hints to help you solve the problem.
Implement your solution in a programming language of your choice. You can create a new file with the appropriate file extension (solution.js, solution.cpp, solution.java, etc.) or modify the existing one if it is already present.
